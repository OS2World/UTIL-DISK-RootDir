RootDir: List the files in the root directory of a floppy disk, including Win95 long names.

This program was written to fill a hole in my own arsenal of programs. Our library system offers free internet access, with downloading of files onto floppy disks permitted. However all the internet PCs run Windows, and at home we use OS/2. Both systems support long file names, but (of course) incompatibly. A program exists to show the Windows long names in a directory listing (called "wir"), but it refuses to read FAT12, so it won't touch our floppies. Rather than restrain myself to 8.3 (or 6.3 in case I overstep somewhere and get a rotten ~1 on the name!), I wrote this program. So far (version 1.0.0), only the root directory is supported (hence the program name), and the path is hardcoded into the program (it will only read from drive A: unless you edit the executable).

LongnameEA.CMD uses RootDir.EXE to list the names, and then adds a .LONGNAME extended attribute to each file with a deadname. Simply run this program (which requires that RootDir.EXE be in the current directory or PATH, and REXXUTIL to be in LIBPATH), then open Drive A in the Workplace Shell. You'll see your long names. Drag one to the Desktop or other folder and it should get the proper name.
